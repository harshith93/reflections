git diff -u <path> <path> /* Finds differences between files*/

git log   /* History of file */

git log --stat	/* History of changes in files */

git init /* Creates a repository */

git status /* Shows the status of changed files */




Appropriate Procedure to commit:

check git status to find the changed files to be committed.

git diff: changes between the files in working directory and staging area.

git diff --staged: changed between the files in staging area and the last commit.

git diff oldCommit_id newCommit_id: changes between the commits.

After checking the status, if any files are found and are supposed to be committed. Add them to staging area using git add.

git add fileName: adds specific file to the staging area.

git add .: adds all the modified files to the staging area and also retains the unchanged files with them.

After adding the files to the staging area, if you are ready to commit use "git commit -m "message"" to commit.

Check for "git log" to see the list of the commits.

Branching:

It helps creating versions of the current projects. We can divide the project to the production and experimental versions.

git branch: displays the current branches in the repository.

git branch "branchName": creates a new branch with the specified name.

Use command "git checkout 'branchName'" to change the working directory to the branch so that the changes committed will be restricted to the new branch not affecting the live or other branches.

Make changes and follow the above procedure for committing.
